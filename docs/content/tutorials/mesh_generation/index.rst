Mesh Generation
***************

Mesh generation with *SimPEG* is done by calling the ``discretize`` package. Tutorials for how to generate meshes can be found on the `discretize tutorials page <http://discretize.simpeg.xyz/en/master/tutorials/mesh_generation/index.html>`__ . 

.. There are 3 types of meshes that can be used in conjunction with SimPEG:

.. .. toctree::
..    :maxdepth: 1

..    2_tensor_mesh
..    3_cyl_mesh
..    4_tree_mesh
